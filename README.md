This Java project simulates an audio application, which offers users the possibility to listen to songs, podcasts, playlists and albums.
In order to access its resources, users send commands (with a timestamp), which are reprezented with JSONs.
Clients have the possibility to search for a specific audio (by any filter), to play it and interact with its flow in many ways. For example, we may pause the content, go forward or backward in podcasts, like songs, repeat tracks or shuffle them in a collection.
Apart from normal users, the application has artists and hosts, that are able to gerate albums and podcasts respectively. They have special pages, so that the normal users can interact with their content.
Users may also search for global statistics about the top 5 albums, playlists, songs or artists
